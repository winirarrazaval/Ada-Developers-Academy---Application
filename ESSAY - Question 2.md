### 2. If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years?

In five years from now, I see myself working as a software developer in a well reputed company where I have plenty of opportunities to learn from talented people and I am exposed to all the different areas of programming. I am particularly interested to learn ways to integrate technology into education.
 
With some experience under my belt, I see myself leading other women, Latinx and mothers into programming and having some influence to open up the field to be more welcoming for all. I would love to volunteer to tutor Hispanic youth and tell them about the many opportunities available to them and tell them about all the role models I have met.
 
I know that to get there is going to be challenging but I have seen other Latina women break into the field and I have seen mothers transitioning back to work successfully. I have confidence that if I apply myself fully and relentlessly and seek support when I need it, I will succeed.
