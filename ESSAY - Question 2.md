### 2. If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years?
In five years from now, my best scenario would be: to have paid my debts, made some savings for my family, and had worked hard in a tech company. By then, it would be time to do what fills my soul, fulfilling my passion of coding, and being fully dedicated to teach underprivileged Chilean young-adults how to code and give them the tools to be able to move up the ladder on their own capabilities.
I once heard the former Minister of Education of Chile saying that the saddest thing in Chile about education is that many people worked their whole lives to pay for a proper university education of their children to gain access to a better quality of life, unfortunately was finally frustratingly and unfruitful. The reason being that in developing countries such as Chile, the kid that does not go to an academic validated university (which many times not aware of), seeks for a job to use their “expensive” knowledge, will most probably  end at with a similar unskilled job as his father/mother but also a big painful debt. This unfortunate reality mixes also with other unfair factors such as racism, classism denoted by details like not looking nor talking like “other”. As George Orwell wrote in his famous book “Animal farm”,
>“All animals are equal, some are more equal than others”.

Within the context of the country with the highest inequality at OECD, making everyone´s opportunities more equal is one of the goal I know I can achieve though a democratic tool as coding.  
More informed than before about the real reality of the country I was born and grew up in, aware of it´s needs and concrete ways to solve some of the biggest problems, I am decided to learn coding to enable the “less equal” to not only have hope but to achieve a better future, meaning a better present. In order to do so, creating a foundation that gives access to young-adults to learn X skills, the potential effects of my actions can have a much bigger effect than my self, the period of time I live at and have a positive impact in generation to come. I would like my sons to feel proud of what I have not only done for them but also for a generation of less privileged people who thanks to my learning can dream and have a better life.
Coding is beautiful as it has the power to democratize and make the uneven more even. It doesn’t matter how you look, where you come from, how you dress. Coding gives freedom to effort people to be who they really are and /or want to be. Coding is a “super” valuable tool, and an amazing journey that opens spaces and a whole universe to lucky people like myself so I can help people not as “lucky”, for me to show them the light out of the tunnel. I am not the light, just can become a good guide. I firmly believe that learning how to code can ignite the light to give hope to many people currently in need of a unbreakable long lasting fishing rod more than a perishable fish.
