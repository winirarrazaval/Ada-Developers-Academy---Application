### 2. If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years?

In five years from now, I see myself working as a software developer in a well reputed company where I have plenty of opportunities to learn from talented people and I am exposed to all the different areas of programming. I am particularly interested to learn ways to integrate technology into education.
 
With some experience under my belt, I see myself leading other women, Latinx and mothers into programming and having some influence to open up the field to be more welcoming for all. I would love to volunteer to tutor Hispanic youth and tell them about the many opportunities available to them and tell them about all the role models I have met.
 
I know that to get there is going to be challenging but I have seen other Latina women break into the field and I have seen mothers transitioning back to work successfully. I have confidence that if I apply myself fully and relentlessly and seek support when I need it, I will succeed.

In five years from now, my best scenario would be: to have paid my debts, made some savings for my family, and had worked hard in a tech company.  
By then, as a commited woman with my country, Chile, and the fight against injustice, I am not comfortable with having the sad record of being the country with the highets inequality rates among OECD. So, I expect to create a foundation that gives access to underprivileged Chilean young-adults to learn how to code and give them the tools to be able to move up the ladder on their own capabilities.


I once heard the former Minister of Education of Chile saying that the most frustrating thing in Chile about education is that many people worked their whole lives to pay for a proper university education of their children to gain access to a better quality of life, unfortunately was finally frustrating and unfruitful. The reason being that in developing countries such as Chile, that kid usually does not go to an academic validated university (which many times not aware of), then seeks for a job to use their “expensive” knowledge and will most probably end with a similar unskilled job as his father/mother making hatred and a more divided country. This unfortunate reality mixes also with other unfair factors such as racism and classism denoted by details like not looking or talking like “other”.  

Coding is beautiful as it has the power to democratize and make the uneven more even. It doesn’t matter how you look, where you come from, how you dress. Coding gives freedom to effort people to be who they really are or/and want to be. Coding is a “super” valuable tool, the potential effects of my actions can have a much bigger effect than my self, the period of time I live at and a positive impact in generations to come. I would like my sons to feel proud of what I have not only done for them but also for a generation of less privileged people who thanks to my learning can dream and have a better life.  

I firmly believe that learning how to code can ignite the light to give hope to many people currently in need of an unbreakable long lasting fishing rod more than a perishable fish.
