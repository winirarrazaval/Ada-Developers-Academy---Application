### 3. After reading Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement, how will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community? http://adadevelopersacademy.org/program

I am a woman of 32 years old, I live with my partner and am proud mother of two little boys. As Chilean born and raised, I am very Latina. I talk loud, I talk about everything (maybe too much), I ask a lot of questions, I give my opinion, and get involved. I enjoy to connect with people at a personal level. But I also know that with my very specific background I tend to view things from my own perspective and it is sometimes hard for me to put myself in other people’s shoes. This has gotten a lot better since I have been living the US for the past 6 years and I have had the opportunity to meet, listen to and learn the stories of many people with different backgrounds. I believe I now know how it feels to be part of a minority, to be appreciated and value being welcomed. 

I mostly understand that while we are all different and unique, as Aristotle stated:
>“The whole is greater than the sum of its parts”.  

In Chile, there is a big problem of elitism and classism. It is hard for young people that do not look or talk like the elites to climb the economic ladder. I would like to partner with other likeminded people to create a foundation that gives access to underprivileged Chilean young-adults to learn how to code and give them the tools to be able to move up the ladder on their own capabilities.

Coding is beautiful as it has the power to democratize and make the uneven more even. It doesn’t matter how you look, where you come from, how you dress. Coding gives freedom to effort people to be who they really are or/and want to be. Coding is a “super” valuable tool, the potential effects of my actions can have a much bigger effect than myself, the period of time I live at and a positive impact in generations to come.

I firmly believe that learning how to code can ignite the light to give hope to many people currently in need of an unbreakable long lasting fishing rod more than a perishable fish.
