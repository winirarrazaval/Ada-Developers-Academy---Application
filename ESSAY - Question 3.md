### 3. After reading Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement, how will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community? http://adadevelopersacademy.org/program

I am a woman of 32 years old, happily married, and proud mother of two little boys. As Chilean born and raised, I am very Latina. I talk loud, I talk about everything (maybe too much), I ask a lot of questions, I give my opinion, and get involved. I enjoy to connect with people at a personal level. Sister to 5 women, I LOVE my inner and extended family.  
I am a Jesuit oriented Christian educated, that above all believes in 3 values which I transmit to my kids, and that I try to be an example of: 

1. LOVE everyone.
2. RESPECT everyone.
3. FORGIVE always. 

Each person has its story. Listen and love before judging. These basic simple principles are the ones I want live, practice and share with Ada’s community with whom I am expectant and anxious to get to know and learn all about.  
Having lived the past 6 years outside my country of origin, I believe I know how it feels to be part of a minority, to be appreciated and value being welcomed.    
I mostly understand that while we are all different and unique, as Aristotle stated:
>“The whole is greater than the sum of its parts”.
