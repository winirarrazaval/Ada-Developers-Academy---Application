### 1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?
Because I want to be that woman who works in what she is passionate about and share that privilege with others, especially with the most vulnerable. 
In early 2016, I saw an Instagram photo of a Chilean entrepreneur with a group of woman. The description stated the following: _“Hurray for @LaboratoriaCL, we need more people learning how to code and more woman in technology, it does not matter where you come from, we need you. More valuable than any high education degree”._  
That same moment I thought this is what I need to do, even do I had never tried coding.

At the same time, I know I am good with technology; I am patient, detail oriented, tolerant to frustration, ambitious, focused, like challenges, doing good and scalability. I was the best at my Technology Class at school and I now learned some coding. I know it is right for me, fits my personality, goals and skills. And this is how I want to give back, I am certain I can be very good at coding and that I can contribute to the world through this life changing shareable cognitive tool and skill.

After deciding I wanted to learn how to code, as a family we moved to Seattle. By searching in Google, I was grateful to find “Ada Developers Academy”, and since then, there has not been a day I haven’t thought about wanting to be part of it and started to expose myself to programing. 
 I asked a friend of my husband to teach me the basics of it. He taught me Ruby, but then I realized I was skipping some steps and needed to start from a more basic stage, so I decided to do courses at Code Academy (HTML, CSS, GIT, RUBY and Command Line). It was great, everything that my friend thought me, made a lot of sense. Finally, I did Ada’s jumpstart, making the whole experience and learning process even more challenging and rewarding at the same time, for me, it definitely made coding an even more clear and meaningful pathway. This learning process made me want to learn coding deeper, having become an undoubtful, enlightening and definitive path in my life. Safe bet for a risk taker woman.
