### 1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?
Because **I want to be that women who works in what she is passionate about and share that privilege with others, especially with the most vulnerable.**  
In early 2016, I saw an Instagram photo of a Chilean entrepreneur with a group of woman. The description stated the following: _“Hurray for @LaboratoriaCL, we need more people learning how to code and more woman in technology, it does not matter where you come from, we need you. More valuable than any high education degree”._  
That same moment I thought this is what I need to do, even tho I had never tried coding.

_**Why?**_ I know I am good with technology; I am patient, tolerant to frustration, ambitious, focused, like challenges, doing good and scalability. I was the best at my Technology Class at school and I now learned some coding. I immediately knew it was right for me, fitted my personality, goals and skills. And then I knew how I could give back, I am certain I can be very good at coding and I can contribute to the world through this life changing shareable cognitive tool and skill.

First, I started researching where I could learn how to code. While living in London as a family we decided to move to Seattle. Next day and by searching in Google, I was grateful to find “Ada Developers Academy”, and since then, there has not been a day I haven’t thought about wanting to be part of it.  

I did not get in in past Adas Cohort, and as I don’t take no for an answer, I am applying again.

 So, I started preparing myself. I asked a friend of my husband to teach me the basics of it. He taught me Ruby. I loved it, enjoyed every second and learned from every homework. But then I realized I was skipping some steps and needed to start from a more basic stage, so I decided to do courses at code academy (HTML, CSS, GIT, RUBY and Command Line). It was great, everything that my friend thought me, made a lot of sense. Finally, I did Ada’s jumpstart, making the whole experience and learning process even more challenging and rewarding at the same time. Now, I firmly believe that even if you might think I did it backwards (from hardest to easiest), for me, it definitely made coding an even more clear and meaningful pathway. It made me want to learn coding deeper, having become a undoubtful, enlightening and definitive path in my life. Safe bet for a risk taker woman.
