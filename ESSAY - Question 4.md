### 4. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?
If I think of the time I made a mistake and REALLY learned about it, just one thing pops in my mind. It was my biggest mistake.  
My father is a recovered alcoholic, and I hated him for many years, for 10 years to be precise. I could just see how much my family suffered, specially my mom. I hated my father and I unconsciously and aggressively-passively punished him. He had been sober for 8 years and I still unfairly hated him.
One day I forgave him and learned how powerful and beautiful it was to forgive. I saw a lovely man who always loved me but had a big problem that at that moment I could not understand. Then for the love he had for our family (and nothing else), he became sober. I realized how hard it must have been for him too, more than for anyone else. Because of his LOVE to our family, he made it.  
Since then, I just love, care and respect him; so much. I try to forgive myself for not having forgot him while needed.  
What I learned is that you can’t judge people if you want to love, respect and forgive.   
If I encountered this situation again, there is a saying that resume my main learning of life : 
>“Everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about. Be kind”.

And that is what I would do differently, be kind.
