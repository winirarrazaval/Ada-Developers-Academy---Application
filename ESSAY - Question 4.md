### 4. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?
If I think of the time I made a mistake and REALLY learned about it, just one thing pops in my mind. It was my biggest mistake.  
My father is a recovered alcoholic, and I hated him for many years, for 10 years to be precise. I could just see how much my family suffered, specially my mom. I hated my father and I unconsciously and aggressively-passively punished him. He had been sober for 8 years and I still unfairly hated him.  
One day, a very special person helped me view the same story with a different view. I saw a lovely man who always loved me but had a big problem that at that moment I could not understand. Then, for the love he had for our family (and nothing else), he became sober. I realized how hard it must have been for him too, more than for anyone else. Because of his LOVE to our family, he made it.  
I forgave him and realized how powerful and beautiful it was to forgive. 
Since then, I just love, care and respect him; so much. I try to forgive myself for not having forgot him while needed.   


What I learned is that you might be trapped and you just need other people to help you with their experiences, views, knoledge and intelligence. 


If I encountered this (or any) situation again, I would ask for help to my people/team and try to work it out with my people.
